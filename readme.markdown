**A fantastic new revival of ATF's classic Spartan, a geometric sans-serif that has no problem kicking its enemies in the chest.** 

Starting the family out with a single weight, we've added in our own take on an strong, historical typeface, and made sure to include an extensive characterset – currently totaling over 300 glyphs. Over time, the open-source license will allow us expand into League Spartan into a full family, with multiple weights and styles, and we're starting by releasing our first Bold style for this exciting, modern classic now.
