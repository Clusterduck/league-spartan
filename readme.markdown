League Spartan
=============
_by [Micah Rich](http://micahrich.com), [Caroline Hadilaksono](http://www.hadilaksono.com), and [Tyler Finck](http://www.sursly.com)_

**A fantastic new revival of ATF's classic Spartan, a geometric sans-serif that has no problem kicking its enemies in the chest.** 

Starting the family out with a single weight, we've added in our own take on an strong, historical typeface, and made sure to include an extensive characterset – currently totaling over 300 glyphs. Over time, the open-source license will allow us expand into League Spartan into a full family, with multiple weights and styles, and we're starting by releasing our first Bold style for this exciting, modern classic now.

In addition, the incredible [Philip von Borries](http://www.vaubee.com) has lovingly crafted a beautiful and detailed animated version of League Spartan to accompany the release – partnering with [Animography.net](http://animography.net/products/league-spartan) to sell at a steal. It's simple to drop into your motion projects, and start customzing it to make some extremely complex, compelling typographic animations. 

Part of the profits are going right back into supporting The League and making more great stuff, so go show everyone you love it and [grab a license today](http://animography.net/products/league-spartan).
